# TOS-alerting

This is Phase 1 of automating trading in the stock market. 

I found that a majority of traders were missing the setups that I posted. My goal of this phase was to alert when a stock was breaking out / breaking down from the weekly watchlist that I provided for that trading week. Using this, they can get alerted when a stock was approaching the breakout / breakdown level and set their trades accordingly. 

In order to do this, I used a workaround with my charting brokerage account. Instead of setting each stock's breakout / breakdown levels and the conditions manually every week, this is designed to take the pre-made email alerts sent from ThinkorSwim and send out the message to the members.
